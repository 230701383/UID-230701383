Introduction

Event planning in this age of digitization offers the users and institutions a vibrant pool of service providers with varying costs and areas of specialization. Selecting the proper vendors that meet the event demands and budget limit is daunting, time-consuming, and most probably results in poor decisions. With the event planning sector expanding perpetually, it is an urgent need to have smart systems to effectively match customers with the correct service providers within budget limits.

Current studies by the industry suggest that the global event management software market is expected to grow to $20.6 billion by 2027 at a compound annual growth rate of 11.2% from 2022 (Grand View Research, 2022). The growth rate emphasizes the urgent need for technology solutions that can make the vendor sourcing process easier while optimizing resource usage.

Our solution addresses this challenge with the creation of a new recommendation system that specializes in pairing users with event service providers based on their personal needs and budget. Unlike conventional e-commerce recommendation systems, our system recognizes the unique characteristics of event planning decisions, where budget allocation is a critical consideration in the decision-making process alongside quality and service requirements.

The system proposed uses a multi-criteria decision-making system that harmonizes user preference, event data, and budget to provide personalized recommendations that maximize value within budgets. The solution integrates both collaborative filtering methods and content-based reasoning to detect user satisfaction patterns across similar events and budgets. Leveraging machine learning models trained on historical event planning experience, the system improves the accuracy of recommendations over time. One of the distinguishing features of our system is the application of dynamic budget allocation optimization, whereby users are able to optimize the distribution of their money across different categories of services according to their needs and event requirements. This bridges the very large gap in current recommendation systems, which primarily cater to preference matching with minimal attention to affordability.

This paper presents the architecture, deployment, and evaluation of our cost-effective event service provider recommendation system. We examine the effect of using financial limitations as a source of input to the recommendation algorithm on user satisfaction and decision quality for event planning activities. In controlled experiments with 150 potential users planning various types of events, we demonstrate a 37% reduction in decision time and a 28% improvement in budget optimization over traditional search methods.

Our findings contribute to the growing literature of domain-specific recommendation systems and have real-world application to event planners and service industry providers. Furthermore, the work lays the groundwork for future research on incorporating budget consciousness into recommendation systems for other domains where economic limitation is the dominant consideration in user decision.
